      {
        "q": "What system does FortuneLab use for Kundli analysis?",
        "a": "FortuneLab uses the Chinese Bazi (Eight Characters) system, which analyses four pillars — year, month, day, and hour of birth — to map the flow of one's destiny. It references five classical source texts validated over centuries, making it a rigorous Eastern counterpart to Vedic Jyotish."
      },
      {
        "q": "How is this different from a traditional Vedic Kundli?",
        "a": "Vedic Jyotish uses planetary positions and house placements, while Bazi maps destiny through the interplay of the five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) derived from your exact birth date and time. Both systems are complementary; Bazi excels at personality and life-cycle timing."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does the AI analyse my chart?",
        "a": "Our calendar engine first calculates your four pillars and solar term boundaries with astronomical precision. An advanced AI model (Claude/GPT) then applies classical interpretive frameworks to generate a personalised, narrative report — in seconds."
      },
      {
        "q": "What if I don't know my exact birth time?",
        "a": "You can still get a meaningful reading using just your birth date. The hour pillar will be missing, which slightly reduces precision. We recommend checking your birth certificate or asking a family elder for best results."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my personal data safe?",
        "a": "We use only your date of birth and gender. Your name is used solely for display in the report. Free readings require no login, and all data is automatically deleted after 90 days."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does a Bazi chart predict good or bad luck?",
        "a": "Bazi does not label a chart as inherently lucky or unlucky — it maps innate strengths, growth areas, and the rhythm of life cycles (similar to the concept of Dasha periods in Jyotish). This service provides probabilistic insights and should not be used as the sole basis for medical, legal, or financial decisions."
