Our engine references five classical texts including Di Tian Sui and Zi Ping Zhen Quan."

      {
        "q": "What if I don't know my birth time?",
        "a": "You can still get a reading without your birth time. The hour pillar will simply be omitted, which slightly reduces the depth of the analysis. We recommend checking your birth certificate or asking a family member to find it."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my personal information safe?",
        "a": "We only use your date of birth and gender for the analysis. Your name is used solely for display in your report. The free reading requires no login and data is automatically deleted after 90 days."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my birth chart \"good\" or \"bad\"?",
        "a": "No chart is inherently good or bad. BaZi reflects the unique pattern of your innate strengths and the natural rhythm of your luck cycles over time. FortuneLab provides probabilistic interpretations — not a basis for medical, legal, or financial decisions."
